## Project Analysis

### User Profile

**Persona:**
**Name:** Emma Martínez
**Age:** 29
**Occupation:** Mid-level UX/UI designer at a tech agency in Barcelona
**Background & Goals:** Emma has been working in design for several years and is actively seeking her next challenge at a forward‐thinking company — perhaps a start-up or creative studio where she can grow into a senior role. She visits your website because she wants to quickly assess your skills, style, and experience. She has limited time and will likely browse on a laptop during her commute or on mobile when she is between meetings.
**Behaviour and Needs:** Emma wants to see a concise overview of your professional identity, your best work, your technical skills, and maybe some personal touches (e.g., story about how you solve problems). She values visual clarity and expects the site to load fast, be easy to navigate, and present information in an elegant modern way. She might also view it from her mobile device so responsiveness is important. The site needs to help her answer: “Can this person design at my level? Would they fit our team and process? Are their skills and style relevant to what we do?”

### Information Architecture

The site structure is created to reflect a typical visitor journey: first establishing who you are, then showing what you do, how you do it, and how they can get in touch. At the top level there is a clear navigation menu with sections such as “About,” “Work,” “Skills,” “Contact.” The homepage acts as a landing area with a powerful intro (name, tagline, short elevator-pitch) and a featured visual or background to anchor your brand. Below that visitors can scroll into the “About” section: a brief biography, your mission, and perhaps a photograph. Next the “Work” section presents your most important projects: each project is summarised with a title, key outcomes and link to more details or visuals. The “Skills” section lists your tools, methodologies, and perhaps proficiency levels (e.g., icons + bars). Finally the “Contact” section offers a simple form or links to email, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc. Throughout the page, consistent calls-to-action (e.g., “View project,” “Get in touch”) reinforce the flow. The architecture ensures a single-page or minimal multi-page design so that users like our persona can stay within one session and find everything without digging through menus. Content grouping and visual hierarchy (headings, summaries, visuals) guide the user from overview to detail seamlessly.

### Visual Design

In the visual design I made decisions to reflect professionalism, clarity, and a touch of personality. I chose a clean, modern typography pairing: a sans-serif for headings to convey crispness and a slightly humanised sans for body text to invite readability. The colour palette is minimal: a dark charcoal for primary text, a bright accent (for example teal or coral) used sparingly for links, buttons and hover states to draw attention without overwhelming the viewer. Background is kept light (off-white) so that content stands out and any photographs or project visuals pop. Visual spacing is generous: ample padding around sections, clear separation between content blocks and consistent margins so the layout breathes. Imagery is used purposefully: perhaps a hero portrait or subtle hero graphic at the top to personalise the site and then project thumbnails to illustrate your work visually. Buttons and links use the accent colour, hover animations are subtle (transform scale, color fade) to give polish but not distract. On mobile the layout adapts: navigation collapses into a hamburger menu, content stacks vertically, images scale fluidly. The overall visual tone is confident yet approachable — signalling that you’re capable and experienced, but also easy to collaborate with.
